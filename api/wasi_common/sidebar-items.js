This provides us a path to evolve WASI by allowing the same WASI Command to import functions from different snapshots - e.g. the user could use Rust’s `std` which imports snapshot 1, but also depend directly on the `wasi` crate which imports some future snapshot 2. Right now, this amounts to supporting snapshot 1 and “snapshot 0” aka wasi_unstable at once."],["table",""]],"struct":[["I32Exit","An error returned from the `proc_exit` host syscall."],["WasiCtx",""]],"trait":[["RngCore","The core of a random number generator."]]};
